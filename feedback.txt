Hi Jake:
it is a superbly done homework: nicely written documentation, well-commented code, good tests, and you even implemented a mysql session store! Everything works, I could easily build a docker image and run it locally. You can shut down your AWS instance, unless you want to keep it for personal reasons (e.g., job search).

You haven't done osv, but it is ok - you earned 5+2=7%.

Thank you,
Mark
